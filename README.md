# Smidge

Smidge is a 2x4+3 key board intended to be used with ARTSEY or Taipo keymaps.
The PCB supports MX (3 and 5-pin), Alps/Matias, Choc (V1 and V2), and Gateron KS-33 (Nuphy Low-Pro) switches.
Powered by a SeeedStudio XIAO module, QMK/Vial firmware is available for the XIAO RP2040 in the 'smidge' folder (with a Vial ARTSEY .vil keymap), and ZMK firmware is available in this repo:
The XIAO module is intended to be directly surface-mount soldered to the PCB, no other components required. For wireless operation, battery terminal solder pads are available under the palm, and a widely compatible slide switch footprint is found between the XIAO and index switches.
A simple tray-mount low-pro case has been designed to be comfortable with the shortest Choc keycaps, while also providing protection from bumps with higher-profle builds.
